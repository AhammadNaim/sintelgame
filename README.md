### Description

An open source adventure game created with Blender (v2.6) based on the open source film 'Sintel'.

The goal of this project was to expand upon the world of Sintel and to develop a platform that enables users to create and share their own content.

### License

Sintel The Game is released under the <a href= "http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT</a> license.

### Development

Sintel The Game uses the <a href= "http://www.blender.org">Blender Game Engine</a> (v2.6) and is programmed in Python. The game is stable on Windows and Linux (as of 2014) but should work on OSX (perhaps with some tweaking).

- sintel_the_game.blend is responsible for setting the resolution and will boot up the game by opening sintel_win.blend
- Each level is split into its own .blend file. Any characters, enemies or props are located in separate .blend files and instanced into the levels. 
- The level selector in the main menu loads .blends from the lib/levels folder
- If you want to make changes to the Player, use lib/characters/sintel_rig_2.blend
